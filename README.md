When Fluent NHibernate 1.0 became available for download we decided to switch to it from NHibernate hbm files. We had about 50 hbm files and wanted to convert them without the usual errors introduced by repetitive boring tasks so we wrote this converter.

This program contains all the features we needed to generate Fluent NHibernate mapping classes from our hbm.xml files. It may not meet all of your needs out of the box. If you find a bug please consider submitting a patch and tests so that others can benefit from your conversion experience.
